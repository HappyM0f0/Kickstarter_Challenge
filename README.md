## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the relationship between a campaign and its launch dates and funding goals. Understanding the impact of which month a campaign starts and if their overall goals can impact whether a campaign is successful.

## Analysis and Challenges

To understand the relationship between a campaign and its corresponding launch date. First, count the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns over a given year. Then consolidate all eight years into a single year. Finally, the data is used in a line chart to show the changes over a year.

Analysis of a campaign and its projected goal includes a detailed count of all Plays and their goals in different categories. For example, the first category counts campaigns with less than $1,000 goals. Then each category afterward measures every $5,000 until $50,000. Next, measure the count of Number Successful against the Total Projects to understand the percentage of successful campaigns for a given goal category. This data is included in a line chart to illustrate the changes in overall categories.

Some challenges encountered include understanding campaigns before 2014 and their impact on the data.

## Results
**What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?**

1. Campaigns in May, June, or July had a higher success rate than other months.
2. Between April and May, campaign success rates have the highest growth Month over Month.

**What can you conclude about the Outcomes-based on Goals?**

Campaign Goals from $4,999 and below and $35,000 to $44,999 had a greater than 60% success rate in reaching their goals.

**What are some limitations of this dataset?**

Data is limited to 8 years and restricted to North America, Europe, Hong Kong, and Singapore.
1369 Theater campaigns participated during these eight years.
2014 data is the first year of significant data(400+); prior years only provide a few data points per year(11).

**What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**

Measuring the correlation between staff picks/Spot Light and how they can influence a campaignâ€”looking at campaigns that receive both, some, or none. 
Additional information can correlate outside events that influence specific campaigns types like a pandemic, recession, or public opinion.
